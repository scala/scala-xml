=========

The standard Scala XML library. Please file XML issues here, not at https://github.com/scala/bug/issues.

The decoupling of scala-xml from the Scala compiler and standard library is possible because the compiler desugars XML literals in Scala source code into a set of method calls. Alternative implementations of these calls are welcome! (The calls are unfortunately only defined by the [implementation](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/ast/parser/SymbolicXMLBuilder.scala).)

API documentation is available [here](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.scala-lang.modules/scala-xml_2.13/).

How to documentation is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/wiki)

The latest stable release of Scala XML is 2.0.0.

## Maintenance status

This library is community-maintained. The lead maintainer is [@aaron_s_hawley](https://github.com/ashawley).

Contributors are welcome, and should read the [contributor guide](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/wiki/Contributor-guide) on the wiki.

## Issues

Many old issues from the Scala JIRA issue tracker have been migrated
here, but not all of them. Community assistance identifying and
migrating still-relevant issues is welcome.  See [this
page](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/issues/62) for details.

## Security best practices

The XML spec has some features that are best turned off, to avoid unsavory things like file system access, DoS attacks,... Issue [#17](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/issues/17) tracks the recommended way of configuring the XML parser used by scala-xml to avoid these. This is by no means an exhaustive list. We'll be happy to incorporate your suggestions -- just comment on the ticket!
