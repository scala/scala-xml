=========

The standard Scala XML library. Please file XML issues here, not at https://github.com/scala/bug/issues.

Since Scala 2.11, this library is a separate jar that can be omitted from Scala projects that do not use XML.

Starting with version 1.1.1, the published jar of scala-xml will be built with Java 7 for Scala 2.11, rather than Java 6.  This change could introduce compatability issues for 2.11 users. More information at [sbt-scala-module#41](https://github.com/scala/sbt-scala-module/issues/41).

The decoupling works because the compiler desugars XML literals in Scala source code into a set of method calls. Alternative implementations of these calls are welcome! (The calls are unfortunately only defined by the [implementation](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/ast/parser/SymbolicXMLBuilder.scala).)

API documentation is available [here](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala-xml/scala/xml/index.html).

How to documentation is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/wiki)

## Cross-building with 2.10

If you are cross-building a project that uses scala-xml with both Scala 2.10 and later Scala versions, take a look at [this example](https://github.com/scala/scala-module-dependency-sample).

## Maintenance status

This library is community-maintained. The lead maintainer is [@aaron_s_hawley](https://github.com/ashawley).

Contributors are welcome, and should read the [contributor guide](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/wiki/Contributor-guide) on the wiki.

## Issues

Many old issues from the Scala JIRA issue tracker have been migrated
here, but not all of them. Community assistance identifying and
migrating still-relevant issues is welcome.  See [this
page](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/issues/62) for details.

## Security best practices

The XML spec has some features that are best turned off, to avoid unsavory things like file system access, DoS attacks,... Issue [#17](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/issues/17) tracks the recommended way of configuring the XML parser used by scala-xml to avoid these. This is by no means an exhaustive list. We'll be happy to incorporate your suggestions -- just comment on the ticket!
